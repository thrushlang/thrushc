# The Thrust Compiler 

There is a simple guide of standard conventions to follow in order to delivery a good Github commit for the Thrust Compiler (**thrustc**).

### Title

It needs to be detailed. It can be include a lot of technical slang.

The base of a well designed Github commit title always will be and needs a specific this syntax as:

#### Title - features

Following the syntax:

`feat(...)`

Valid locations:

- `llvm_backend` Any location that usually involucrates the LLVM backend.
- `gcc_backend` Any location that usually involucrates the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) backend.
- `frontend` Any locations that usually involucrates the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Lexer, Parser, TypeChecker and we could continue...
- `project-visual` Any location that usually involucrates the visual representation or human guide for the compiler available on Github (Example: README.md).
- `project` Any location that usually involucrates Cargo, Rust Compiler and Github repository changes or the conception of a new part of the compiler (Cargo Workspaces).

Example:

`feat(llvm_backend) Adding support for TLS Thread priority.`

#### Title - fixes

Following the syntax:

`fix(...)`

Valid locations:

- `llvm_backend` Any location that usually involucrates the LLVM backend.
- `gcc_backend` Any location that usually involucrates the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) backend.
- `frontend` Any locations that usually involucrates the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Lexer, Parser, TypeChecker and we could continue...

Any consecutive location written to the next one needs to be follow for a COMMA character `,`.

Example:

`fix(frontend) Fixing several issues on the abstract syntax analyzer.`

#### Title - Combinatory

In order to create a well disigned combinatory title, you need to use the following syntax:

`(feat(...), fix(...))`

- It needs to be encapsulated for a pair characters PAREN `()`.
- Each next feature or fix needs to be followed for a COMMA character `,`. 

### Description

It needs to be concise, short, but detailed in the same time. It can be include a lot of technical slang.
