# The Thrush Compiler 

The **Thrush Compiler** is a monolithic compiler that transfers the source code of Thrush files directly to the specified destination. The process includes static type analysis, code generation, destination-specific optimizations, machine-specific code compilation, and finally, emitting or linking.

> [!WARNING]  
> The compiler is in an early development phase. It may contain bugs when testing certain syntax. Continue on your own.

## Getting Started

### Build dependencies 

Among the dependencies required by the compiler is LLVM infrastructure.

Automatically:

```console
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/thrushlang/compiler-builder 
$ cd compiler-builder 
$ cargo run 
```

You must first clone the repository and access it locally. 

```console
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/thrushlang/thrushc 
$ cd thrushc
```

### Build the Compiler

Now you need to have Rust installed with a recent version.

- \>= **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** (v1.18.5) 
- Rust 2024 Edition

Now you need to compile the compiler with Rust. 

```console
$ cargo run -- --help
```

## Commands & Flags

## Syntax 

The language syntax is under construction at the same time as the compiler. It may be outdated compared to the compiler, as the latter progresses more rapidly. This will be normalized once a valid and sufficiently stable beta is released.

**[Thrush Programming Language - General Syntax](https://github.com/thrushlang/syntax)**

## ¿How it works?

Currently, the only backend available for the thrush compiler to compile is the current LLVM, using the LLVM-C API. 

#### Embedded Clang

The compiler has Clang compiled for Linux & Windows inside the executable in case the programmer does not have access to it; however, you can specify a custom Clang & GCC.

#### Code Generations Phases

The code generation is in 3 phases. 

- Intermediate Code Generation (``LLVM IR``).
- Emit object files (``.o``). 
- Linking with some linker through the ``Clang`` or ``GCC`` C compilers. ~ *Rust 2015 be like*

## LLVM

The LLVM backend infrastructure is the default code generator for the **[Thrush Programming Language](https://github.com/thrushlang/)**. It offers full scope and portability across many architectures or targets.

### LLVM Version

- ``17.0.6``
 
#### Why this specific version of LLVM for the compiler?

Between version 16-17, the introduction to the change of typed pointers was made, which are now almost a standard in the backend. 

Some programming languages like Swift tend to use versions lower than 16 of LLVM, for reasons of compatibility with code generation that differs between higher and lower versions of LLVM, and version 16 offers legacy support for languages that need it.

We only need support for C and nothing else. We are not interested in FFI with C++ for the moment, nor in mangling with it either.
17 is enough and from there on.

#### LLVM Targets

Beyond the standard triple targets, the compiler also supports all architectures available through the **[LLVM](https://llvm.org)**-C API. These include:

- ``x86_64``
- ``AArch64``
- ``RISC-V``
- ``ARM``
- ``MIPS``
- ``PowerPC``
- ``SystemZ``
- ``AMDGPU``
- ``Hexagon``
- ``Lanai``
- ``LoongArch``
- ``MSP430``
- ``NVPTX``
- ``SPARC``
- ``XCore``
- ``BPF``
- ``SPIR-V``
- ``WebAssembly``

## GCC

The GCC compiler backend is still under construction.

In the future, you will be able to use it with the ``-gcc-backend`` flag to use the GCC backend code generator instead of the default LLVM one.

However, it is only available on **GNU/Linux**.

You must also have ``libgccjit.so`` dynamically installed in your distribution so that the compiler doesn't get scared at runtime when using GCC.

### Notes

Currently, the very same Rust is using ``libgccjit`` as a library for an AOT backend prototype for Rust. Called ``rustc_codegen_gcc``. Thrush will integrate it in his own way for use in the language.

# Frequent Questions

#### > Why isn't the compiler designed to use it as a bootstrap compiler?

Regarding the concept of bootstrapping in compilers (For more information: https://www.bootstrappable.org/).

The decision was made to fully implement all the programming language functions in the compiler written in Rust, because it proposes a development approach similar to what Gleam Team did for Gleam Programming Language, and also to lighten the workload, given that we are already using LLVM.
